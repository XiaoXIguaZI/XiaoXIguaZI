## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by!

Hi there! I'm Joy. I started my academic journey with a background in Economics at [UIBE](https://english.uibe.edu.cn) and later pursued a Masterâ€™s in Public Policy (MPP) at the University of Chicago, where I specialized in [Data Analytics](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/design-your-path/specializations/specialization-data-analytics) and [Finance and Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/design-your-path/specializations/specialization-finance-policy).
