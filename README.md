## Hi there üëã Thanks for stopping by!

Hi there! I'm Joy. I started my academic journey with a background in Economics at [UIBE](https://english.uibe.edu.cn) and later pursued a Master‚Äôs in Public Policy (MPP) at the [University of Chicago](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/master-public-policy-mpp), where I specialized in [Data Analytics](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/design-your-path/specializations/specialization-data-analytics) and [Finance and Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/design-your-path/specializations/specialization-finance-policy), refining my ability to leverage data for real-world decision-making.

üí° **What I Do:**  
 - üìä **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
Proficient in Python, R, Fortran, Stata, SPSS and SQL, with extensive experience in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and creating insightful visualizations to inform decision-making.‚Äã  
 - üè¶ **Finance & Valuation**  
‚ÄãSkilled in asset pricing, macroeconomics, fixed income, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and financial accounting, with a specialized focus on energy sector valuations, including hydropower modeling and renewable energy assessments.‚Äã

Feel free to take a look at my [resume](https://xiaoxiguazi.github.io/XiaoXIguaZI/Resume_LepengWu(DA).pdf) and to connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lepengwu2023/).   

**You can see some of my work in the following repositories:**
1. [**Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Finance**](https://github.com/XiaoXIguaZI/HW4_website): The coursework entailed extracting economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website using pandas_datareader, processing the data with techniques such as pandas' groupby for weighted standard deviation and numpy for weighted percentiles, and applying **PCA** using sklearn.decomposition.PCA to identify key components influencing the dataset. For more information about the [course at Finmath Uchi](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/degree-concentrations/financial-computing/finm-32900/), please refer to the [instructor's materials](https://finm-32900.github.io/index.html).‚Äã
2. [**UST Yield Curve Comparative Analysis**](https://github.com/XiaoXIguaZI/UST_YieldCurve_Analysis?tab=readme-ov-file): This repository extends the UST Yield Curve Analysis by refining yield curve fitting methods from [Coleman, Ibbotson, and Fisher‚Äôs research](https://books.google.com/books/about/Historical_U_S_Treasury_Yield_Curves.html?id=T7ubQAAACAAJ) using CRSP monthly bond data. It systematically compares different forward rate curve models, evaluating variations in **piecewise constant, piecewise twisted structures, breakpoints, option flags, and transformations (log, normal, square root, etc.)** It compares forward rate curve models through processed rate results including piecewiceconstant, piecewisetwisted, monthly yield curve visualizations for specific quote dates, and [interactive time-series plots](https://xiaoxiguazi.github.io/UST_YieldCurve_Analysis/parbd_rate.html) across maturities. The repository provides monthly yield curve visualizations for specific quote dates and interactive time-series plots for comparative analysis across maturities.
4. [**Variance Decomposition of Credit Spreads: A Replication and Extension of Nozawa (2017)**](https://github.com/XiaoXIguaZI/finm32900-final-project): This repository replicates and extends the analysis from Yoshio Nozawa‚Äôs ["What Drives the Cross-Section of Credit Spreads?: A Variance Decomposition Approach."](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/what-drives-the-cross-section-of-credit-spreads-a-variance-decomposition-approach.htm). We reconstruct key datasets and tables from the original study while updating them with data through December 31, 2023. The replication incorporates corporate bond test assets from [He, Kelly, and Manela (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X1730212X) and refines the methodology by integrating a comprehensive panel dataset from Lehman Brothers, TRACE, and Mergent FISD/NAIC. We employ **cubic spline interpolation** to construct risk-free rates and apply **variance decomposition** techniques to analyze the drivers of credit spreads. The [results](https://xiaoxiguazi.github.io/finm32900-final-project/reports/Final%20Project%20Report.pdf) largely align with Nozawa‚Äôs findings, though variations emerge in portfolios with higher yield spreads, emphasizing the impact of preprocessing steps on replication accuracy.
5. [**Global Value Chain Participation and Carbon Emissions: A Replication and Visualization Study**](https://github.com/XiaoXIguaZI/GVC_CarbonEmissions_Analysis): This repository examines how Global Value Chain (GVC) participation affects CO‚ÇÇ emissions, combining empirical replication, extended data analysis, and interactive visualization. Building on [Wang et al. (2017)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2937551) and Wu (2024), we replicate key methodologies while refining data processing and [visualization](https://xiaoxiguazi.github.io/GVC_CarbonEmissions_Analysis/writeup/Write-Up.pdf). We focus on country- and industry-level GVC participation patterns using **Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) modeling, Quantile OLS regressions**, and dynamic visualization tools. The project leverages Python (pandas, numpy, Altair, Shiny) to process and visualize global trade-emission linkages, offering insights into sustainable policy strategies.
6. [**MachineLearning_Labyrinth**](https://github.com/XiaoXIguaZI/MachineLearning_Labyrinth): This repository implements machine learning models to predict whether a news article will make it to the ["Hot Search"](https://uhlibraries.pressbooks.pub/chin3343sp23/chapter/hotsearch/) list on Sina Weibo. By analyzing textual features, metadata, and engagement metrics, I develop [predictive models](https://xiaoxiguazi.github.io/MachineLearning_Labyrinth/Pred_SinaWeibo/predictive%20model.pdf) using **logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests**.
